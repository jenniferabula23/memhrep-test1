                        People who suffer from Mental illness are widespread across the world. About 25 percent of the
                        world's population have this diagnosis, but there are immense debates about mental illness, the
                        causes, and the required steps leading to the total healing. People who are suffering from this
                        kind of illness sometimes encounter difficulties in either their thinking abilities, their
                        emotions or activities. These at times could lead to the destruction of the efficiency,
                        relationships and quality of life of these people. The outcomes of this illness have mostly been
                        unbearable for the family and friends, as well as the patients.

                    People who are looked down upon in their everyday life, as a result of suffering from mental
                    illness, are uncountable. This is because, mental illnesses are some of the least meaningful
                    situation in the society.
                    However, unlike the images often found in articles, books, on television and in films, most people
                    can lead generative and efficient lives when given good treatment and assistance. Drugs and medical
                    treatments are good for some people, but this is not always the cure. Medical treatment may play a
                    part in the recovery process, and not necessarily the main part.

                    It should be noted that someone with mental illness is not the person's mistake, it's not a sign of
                    weakness, and it's not something to be embarrassed of.
                    It's too narrow to position someone's problems solely as an illness that requires medical treatment.
                    As a result of this, people are prevented from thinking about the many different influences on
                    someone's life, thoughts, feelings and behaviour that can cause mental distress. It may also prevent
                    people from exploring the different kinds of non-medical treatment choices that are available. For
                    these reasons, some people prefer to talk about mental or emotional distress, rather than mental
                    illness.

                                        There are different classes or diagnosis of mental distress according to
                                        Psychiatrists. A doctor is able to measure what treatment is needed and also to
                                        determine the outcome when he or she makes a diagnosis. It can also be an

                                        if there are cultural, social or religious differences between doctor and
                                        patient. Each patient has different diagnosis by different doctors. If we just
                                        concentrate on the symtoms, we will not take the necessary notice of what the
                                        sufferer might be experiencing. The medical diagnosis might be unable to justify
                                        the suffererâ€™s full experience.

                                        Diagnosis can be very damaging if it becomes a label. For example, instead of
                                        being seen as a parent, writer, mechanic or student who has schizophrenia, a
                                        person may be seen as 'a schizophrenic', as though this diagnosis summed them
                                        up. It's necessary to retrieve that a diagnosis does not have to determine the
                                        whole course of life, and may come to be a fairly minor part of an individual's
                                        identity or history.

                                        Mental distress is possible to totally recover and this has been the case for
                                        many people. Sometimes, they even recover from the suffering feeling stronger
                                        and wiser. Others get over the worst, but remain vulnerable, and relapse from
                                        time to time. Some don't recover, and will continue to receive treatment in the
                                        long term.

                                        There are many types of Mental distress. In everyday life, we sometimes use
                                        words to diagnose them, for example, 'depression' or 'anxiety'. This can make
                                        them seem easier to understand, but their closeness can mean underestimating
                                        just how intense and incapacitating these conditions may be.
                                        The following are some of the most commonly diagnosed types of mental distress:

                                        Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. All
                                        most everyone occasionally go through spells of feeling down, but when one is
                                        depressed, there persistent feeling of sadness for weeks or months rather than
                                        just a few days.
                                        Some people still think that depression is trivial and not a genuine health
                                        condition. They're wrong. Depression is a real illness with real symptoms, and
                                        it's not a sign of weakness or something one can 'snap out of' by 'pulling
                                        yourself together'. The good news is that with the right treatment and support,
                                        most people can make a full recovery from depression.
                                        Depression affects people in many different ways and can cause a wide variety of
                                        symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of sadness and hopelessness to losing
                                        interest in the things individual used to enjoy and feeling very tearful or
                                        anxious.

                                        There can be physical symptoms too such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping
                                        badly, having no appetite or sex drive and complaining of various aches and
                                        pains. The severity of the symptoms can vary. At its mildest, an individual may
                                        simply feel persistently low in spirit, while at its most severe, depression can
                                        make one feel suicidal and that life is no longer worth living. Depression often
                                        goes alongside with anxiety.

                                        Anxiety can refer to an invariable and unrealistic worry or fear, about any
                                        aspect of everyday life that can be mild or severe. Everyone experiences
                                        feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. For example, an individual may
                                        feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam or having a medical test or job
                                        interview.
                                        Feeling anxious is sometimes perfectly normal. However, people with generalised
                                        anxiety disorder (GAD) find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of
                                        anxiety are more constant and often affect their daily life. GAD is a long-term
                                        condition which causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and
                                        issues, rather than one specific event. People with GAD feel anxious most days
                                        and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. GAD can cause
                                        both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. These vary from person to
                                        person.
                                        There are several conditions for which anxiety is the main symptom. Sleeping
                                        problems, restlessness and other possibly physical symptoms; for example, an
                                        increased heartbeat, stomach upset, muscle tension or feeling shaky may be
                                        caused as a result of anxiety. Someone who is highly anxious may also develop
                                        related problems, such as panic attacks, a phobia or obsessive compulsive
                                        disorder.

                                        A panic attack occurs when an individual body experiences a rush of intense
                                        psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. These are sudden, unexpected bouts
                                        of intense terror. A person may find it difficult to breathe, and feel their
                                        heart beating hard when an individual gets panic attack. They may have a choking
                                        sensation and a pain in the chest, begin to tremble or feel faint. It's easy to
                                        error these for the marks of a heart attack or another serious problem. What
                                        differentiates panic attacks from a natural response to real danger is that,
                                        panic attacks can occur at any time.
                                        If a person gets panic attack, it doesn't necessarily mean that the person will
                                        have it again. But, sometimes, because of what people went through, they become
                                        afraid of having another. This fear may actually initiate another attack when a

                                        Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic (long-term) mental health
                                        condition that is usually associated with obsessive thoughts and compulsive
                                        behaviour.
                                        An individual who sufferers from OCD feels they have no command over certain
                                        thoughts or ideas that are highly troubling to them, but which seem to force
                                        themselves into consciousness. These thoughts, or obsessions, create unbearable
                                        anxiety, which can only be relieved by executing a particular ritual to nullify
                                        them. This could be something like repeatedly opening and closing a door,
                                        washing hands, or counting.
                                        OCD is one of the most common mental health conditions. It is estimated that up
                                        to 3 in 100 adults and up to 5 in 100 children and teenagers have OCD. OCD
                                        usually starts in early adult life, with men tending to report earlier symptoms
                                        than women. However, OCD symptoms can begin at any time, including childhood.

                                        A phobia is an unreasonable fear of a particular situation or object. It imposes
                                        such restrictions on the way people live which causes major disruption to life.
                                        Agoraphobia can cause such paralysing fear that a person may remain isolated in
                                        their own home, afraid to go out. Other common phobias include fear of animals,
                                        heights, flying and enclosed spaces.

                                        Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder. During 'manic' episodes, people tend to be

                                        Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating of all mental illnesses and can
                                        severely interfere with someone's ability to perform everyday tasks and
                                        activities.
                                        Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of
                                        different psychological symptoms. Symptoms may include: hallucinations (hearing
                                        voices and seeing things that other people can't); delusions - unusual beliefs
                                        that are not based on reality and often contradict the evidence; muddled
                                        thoughts based on the hallucinations or delusions; and changes in behaviour.
                                        Schizophrenia has been described as a psychotic illness. This means that
                                        sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas
                                        from reality.

                        There are many suggestions about the causeâ€™s mental distress. The causes of mental distress is
                        part of a wider debate about what makes people the way they are, whether who they are is as a
                        result of the life experiences they have been through, or whether it's determined by their
                        genes, inherited from their parents. It's possible that some people are more vulnerable to
                        mental health problems, which could be triggered by stressful or traumatic events.
                        The following are some of the possible causes of mental distress. It may be as a result of any
                        one of these factors, or a compounding of them.

                        People become highly unsafe and more vulnerable to mental distress when they grow up feeling not

                        excessively protected can also put a child at risk.

                        From a very early age, a child may have been discouraged from expressing his feelings. You may
                        even have been penalized for getting angry, crying or laughing too Clamorously as a child. Your
                        mental health is also affected by feelings that are restrained, which are not uttered.

                        Your mind can be affected by your body chemistry. For example, a hormone called adrenalin is
                        produced if you are frightened and it triggers the body's 'fight or flight' response. The body
                        remains tense and the mind stays over-active, if physical activity doesn't use up all the
                        adrenalin.

                        ou inherit physical characteristics from your parents and can pass them on in the same way. Your
                        personality can also be affected by your genes.
                        Physical illnesses can be caused by genes. In the same way, there may be genes that predispose a
                        person towards mental illness. The idea that one person may be more likely than another to
                        develop a particular problem, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia is supported by some
                        scientific evidence.
