        Generally speaking, Mental illness, like any other illness of the
        body, is a deviation from the normal and acceptable function of
        any part of the body, be it an organ or a system. In respect of the
        subject under discussion, we are talking about a deviation from
        the normal thought and behavioural pattern of the mentally challenged.


      <blockquote class="blockquote bq-warning container">

        <p>
          Christians from diﬀerent theological backgrounds hold varied perception about mental illness as
          regarding the cause of it and how the mentally challenged should be treated. Some think that mental
          illness is demon orchestrated and as such the mentally-ill should be seen as demon possessed and
          demon oppressed and therefore should be viewed with the same lenses as one would a demon. This
          reason may underpin the inhumane and treacherous handling and treatment of the mentally-ill in some
          Christian worship centres where some support is being oﬀered. Some ‘Prayer Camps’ go the length of
          chaining the mentally-ill and leaving them in the open under the mercy of the prevailing weather.
          Others are denied food with the intention of helping then fast for quick deliverance, while others
          receive beating of all sorts as a means of exorcising the demon inhabiting them.

      <blockquote class="blockquote bq-success container">

        <p>
          Some Christians also think of mental illness as a punishment inﬂicted on the mentally -ill by themselves,
          i.e., the results from sinful habits such as abuse of drugs, repercussion from occultism and a curse placed
          on the mentally challenged by those they have wronged.

          Others still see mental illness as a natural cause of event as in the case of many other body illnesses.
          I seek to cursory consider what the Bible says about mental illness and the mentally -ill person and draw
          out some lessons for our instruction on how Christians should perceive and handle the mentally
          challenged.

        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY?</h4>

        <p>
          In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, mention is made of mental deranged conditions.
          Various translations make use of diﬀerent terminologies to include, demon possession (ref., Matt. 8:28-
          34; Mark 5:2-20), epilepsy (Matt. 17:14-18; Mark 9:17-27) and insanity (Deut. 28:28).
          The Old Testament cites two prominent kings who suﬀered mental derangement as a result of being
          punished by God for disobedience. The ﬁrst is King Saul, king of Israel (I Sam. 16:14; 18:10), who is
          described as being tormented by an evil spirit from the Lord because the Spirit of the Lord departed
          from him. The second example cited is King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon (Daniel 4:28 -33), whose
          condition was reduced to that of a beast. King David is mentioned as feigning madness Achish, king of
          Gath and his people to escape being considered a threat when he ﬂed from the presence of King Soul
          (I Sam. 21:13-15).

      <blockquote class="blockquote bq-warning container">

        <p>
          In the New Testament the mention of mental disorders is portrayed as illness manifesting itself in
          diﬀerent psychological and physiological imbalances such as epilepsy (Matt. 17:15), violence (Mark 5:2 -
          20) and convulsion (Luke 9:37-42).
          The Old Testament references are seen as punishment from God on the disobedient while the New
          Testament portrays the mental conditions as demon orchestrated. In each of the New Testament
          references, the common factor is that Jesus had compassion on them and healed them.

      <blockquote class="blockquote bq-success container">
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHRISTIAN TOWARDS THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED</h4>
        <p>
          The God of the Bible is a compassionate God. He revealed Himself to Moses as “the compassionate and
          gracious one” (Exodus 34:6). Compassion is at the very core of God’s character. To be compassionate is
          to be sympathetic and concerned for the suﬀerings or misfortunes of others, especially, the vulnerable.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          It was this character in Jesus Christ that moved Him to helping all who came to Him (Matt. 9:36; 14:14).
          Christians are enjoined by the Holy Scriptures to cloth ourselves with the same attiude (Eph. 4:32; Col.
          3:12; James 1:27; 1 John 3:17) and this is where the work of MEMHREP is not only commendable but
          also worth supporting. The mentally challenged is arguably the second most vulnerable group in the
          society apart from children.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          From the parable on the judgement of the nations (Matt. 25:31 -46), the Lord Jesus speaks of judgement
          based on deeds towards fellow man and especially, the vulnerable i.e. the hungry, the thirsty, strangers,
          the naked, the sick and the imprisoned. The startling point however is the verses 40 and 45 where the
          Lord clearly states that whatever we do to any one of these little ones in His name is a gesture towards
          Him and vice versa.

        </p>

      </blockquote>
      <br>

      <blockquote class="blockquote bq-success container">
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">LESSONS DRAWN</h4>
        <p>
          From the above discourse, we learn that mental illness, notwithstanding how they came about, is an
          unfortunate situation that attracted the compassion of the Lord. As followers of Christ, we cannot but
          demonstrate same attiude of compassion toward the mentally ill person.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Again, we see that Jesus was very humane in His approach in helping the mentally challenged. The
          Church, Para-church organisations and NGOs in mental health are to adopt very humane methods in
          handling the mentally challenge. After all, the aim is to help these vulnerable brothers and sisters out
          of their unfortunate predicament.
        </p>

      </blockquote>
      <br>

      <blockquote class="blockquote bq-success container">
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p>
          In conclusion, I choose to quote 1 John 3:17 which states, “Whoever has earthly possessions and notices
          a brother in need and yet withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God be present in
          him?” By this, I think Christians should stop passing judgement on the mentally-ill but rather be moved
          by compassion to oﬀer support in prayer, counselling and materially.
          God will accept our heart and gifts and may be deliver these vulnerable brothers and sisters made in
          God' own image.
        </p>
