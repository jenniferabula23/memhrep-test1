                                It’s a shame how mental health is given little attention but it’s one of the most
                                important aspects of health.
                                Kudos to MEMREP for making mental health a priority and helping people understand their
                                mental health needs as well as helping them manage it.
                                I’m proud to be volunteering to this worthy course.

                                I was mentally ill, a drug addict and as a result abandoned on the streets of Adum -
                                Kumasi ( Ghana) at the tender age of nine( 9).
                                I was sexually abused and got pregnant with nobody to cater for my medical and physical
                                needs.
                                I came in contact with MEMHREP during one of their street outreach programs at Asafo -
                                Kumasi.
                                They paid my ante and post natal bills, provided materially and to my outmost surprise,
                                housed me till I delivered and beyond.
                                As if that was not enough, six months after delivery, they put me on training for work.
                                Words alone cannot express the help rendered me by MEMHREP. All I can say is God richly
                                bless you MEMHREP.

                                The stigma attached to mental illness has resulted in service users losing their jobs
                                and other valuable assets after recovery.They are not recognized nor accorded the needed
                                respect.There are no measures in place to reintegrate them into society after
                                recovery.There are no laid down policies to support them financially.This occurrence has
                                delayed the recovery of many service users.
                                Thumbs up to MEMHREP,a non profit making organization that seeks the wellbeing of the
                                mentally ill by providing free medical care(both physically and psychologically),
                                financial support, helping them learn a trade and other needs of these clients in order
                                to make them feel like 'royals'.

                                My name is Joseph Adeyeli. I often isolate myself from the public because of my condition. I do that because, I don’t know when next a seizure would occur, I have suffered from epilepsy for the past 12 years and a service user from MEMHREP – GH. About 5 years ago, I was introduced to the NGO by a nurse from Ejisu government hospital. 
                                Because of financial problems, I wasn’t going for my monthly reviews regularly and was always having seizures, so the nurse upon hearing my story introduced me to MEMHREP.
                               The benefits I have derived by associating with MEMHREP are enormous. My medical bills and monthly reviews are all now taken care of. I also receive financial support as well as clothing and food allowance from MEMHREP. 
                               I want to take this opportunity to say a very big thank you to MEMHREP for their tremendous support.

                                The swift do not always win the race, nor do the mighty win the battle says the Bible.
                                Another adage goes” The world is wicked on the little ones.
                                My name is Linda Boateng. I was born a normal and healthy like any other kid. During my
                                school days, I was very brilliant. My ambition was to become a nurse.
                                After secondary school, I got married to a wonderful husband. Three months after
                                delivery, I heard strange voices speak to me. On many occasions, I would lock myself up
                                in a dark room and severally attempted suicide.
                                In my bid to seek medical treatment, I came into contact with herbalists and fake men of
                                God who swindled me of the little cash on me. My bills were too huge to afford that I
                                completely isolated myself socially.
                                Fortunately, a relative introduced me to MEMHREP. With their help, I have received
                                proper medical help from both Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and Tafo government
                                hospital respectively. Because of MEMHREP’s intervention, I can say” I am whole and
                                sane…….. they have changed my social status and also given me a second chance in life”.
                                I cannot end without asking the general public to assist this noble organisation
                                financially or any form of support so they can help similar persons suffering mentally.

                                I am 34 year old mother of three beautiful girls. I speak fluent French, Ewe and
                                English. I spent most of my life in Togo, a small country that borders Ghana to the
                                East.
                                Words cannot describe how I felt when the medical doctor told me I was pregnant with my
                                first child. Fast forward, I delivered twins on three different occasions of which all
                                the males died. It felt like walking through hell with a smile. I got lonely and
                                depressed so much that I would hear strange* voices speak to me. To make matters worse,
                                I got out of home leaving my daughters at the care of my sick mother.
                                My first encounter with MEMHREP was miraculous for want of a better word. I had visited
                                my family at Aboagye Estates, Okyerekrom when I had a relapse. The health team of
                                MEMHREP who was on community outreach at that time took pity at my condition and swiftly
                                arranged for me to be taken to Ejisu government hospital for medical attention. In weeks
                                and months that followed, the NGO has cared for me medically, financially and
                                emotionally.
                                I have also been reunited with my kids and put to work. If not for MEMEHREP, I would
                                have being living on the streets by now. I am forever grateful to MEMHREP.

                                I was brought up in the Christian faith and of the Catholic doctrine. God has been very good to me by blessing me with three kids: two males and a female.
                                In years gone, I traded in foodstuffs that provided me the opportunity to support and complement my late husband financially. Life was relatively good for us. Suddenly my husband was taken ill and would not survive few months after visiting various hospitals. The demise of my husband was the beginning of my sickness. Days and nights after his passing, I locked myself up, hurt myself with sharp objects. I would also not eat, let alone take my bath. To add salt to my already bloody injury, I was kicked out of my matrimonial home. Anxiety and depression set in and eventually I became mentally unstable. My situation became so dire that, I couldn’t afford the medication prescribed by the doctor. I got into contact with the NGO through its community outreach program on 12 December, 2018.
                                MEMEHREP ( Community  Mental Health Support Team) came to offer me help when hope was all lost. Throughout the years, they have taken care of all my medical needs and bills. Financially I have not been left out. With their support, my monthly reviews are attended to. I am very grateful to have met them. God richly bless MEMHREP for the care, support and assistance for persons with mental health needs.

                                MEMHREP. The name is quite a mouthful but the work they do is godly.
                                Afia Nyameboah Serwaah is my name and a native of Manhyia near Konongo in the Ashanti region of Ghana. When I was 15 years, I fell severely ill and as a result dropped out of school. Because of my condition, I have never had a partner to live with. Also am unable to visit the market where I sell food crops for a living because of the stigmatization that I encounter daily.
                                About 5 years ago, I met MEMEHREP when they embarked on mental health outreach program in the Ejisu district . Through the help I received from them, my condition has improved tremendously because they purchase my drugs and take me to my monthly reviews.
                                I am now back on my feet as a result of the help I got from MEMHREP. If ever there’s a better word than THANK YOU, I will use that for them. God will surely reward you for helping humanity.

                                I am told I got into this condition during the walking stage of my infant days. Mother tells me even in those hard times, I was a delight and her favourite friend. My wish is that my father had experienced those wonderful moments with me. Sad to say I never saw his face. He died when I was just a year old.
                                I am a young girl suffering from epilepsy. As a result of my condition, I dropped out of school because of the stigma. Life is indeed tough on me. The trauma alone is unbearable. Sometimes I wonder what wrong I have done to deserve this.
                                Fortune smiled on me when together with my mother met a nurse of MEMEHREP about 6 years ago. Life has turned for the better because through MEMHREP’s intervention, I regularly visit the hospital for reviews and my drugs are catered for.
                                But like Oliver Twist, I want to ask for more. My childhood dreams has always been that I became a dressmaker. I know that can become a reality when the government, individuals, religious bodies would come to the aid of MEMHREP financially. Therefore to end my story, I would like to thank MEMHREP for the help rendered me. May the almighty Allah bless their efforts at making life easy for persons living with mental illness.

                                It’s been a unique relationship built on love and trust. This relationship began when I got into alcol abuse, depression and climaxing to mental illness.
                                My sickness has brought untold hardships and disappointment to my family and friends. I’ve had to sell all that I hold dear just to recover and live a simple, healthy and happy life. My sickness is characterised by an aggressive behaviour. That has prevented my family members from getting closer to me thereby adding to my loneliness and depression.
                                About 7 years ago, I got relieved when MEMHREP came to my assistance. Through their friendly approach and well­ structured counselling sessions, I have been able to receive the needed medical and social help. My family life is better now and currently engaged in farming thanks to MEHREP.
                                I can confidently say that” MEMHREP was my saviour and safe haven when I was in despair. I am not an isolated case, therefore help MEMHREP to help others”.

                                I am a form 2 student of Okyerekrom M/A JHS in the Ejisu district of the Ashanti region of Ghana. I love reading, written and watching local movies at my leisure. On weekend I hardly miss my favourite food” fufu”.
                                It’s sad to narrate that I was born with a physical disability on my left arm. All efforts to remedy my defect has been futile. In school and all social gatherings, I always try to shy away because of the stigma that comes with my condition. Financially, my family is handicapped as a result of my father’s demise.
                                I have been a beneficiary of MEMHREP’s Community Support Program since 2022. I receive support in the form of money, food and clothing. This benevolence on MEMHREP’s part, has kept me going and I am indeed grateful. On behalf of my family, I would want to say a big “AYEKOO” to MEMHREP.

                                I woke up on a hospital bed in 14th October 2022. I was told the CEO of MEMHREP and his health team who was embarking on community mental health outreach saw me on that faithful day dirty and unkempt and sent me to the hospital for medical attention.
                                I was raised up in an orphanage after my parents divorced. During my stay, I experimented with weed and eventually got addicted. Also I engaged in other social vices that put my mental health state into danger. My addiction came with an aggressive behaviour, fits of anger. This got me out of my family house, acquainting myself with bad company.
                                With MEMHREP’s help, I have regained my sanity. They have provided me with medication, food and clothing. I look forward to working with them. Thank you!
