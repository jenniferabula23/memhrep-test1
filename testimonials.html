                                It’s a shame how mental health is given little attention but it’s one of the most
                                important aspects of health.
                                Kudos to MEMREP for making mental health a priority and helping people understand their
                                mental health needs as well as helping them manage it.
                                I’m proud to be volunteering to this worthy course.

                                I was mentally ill, a drug addict and as a result abandoned on the streets of Adum -
                                Kumasi ( Ghana) at the tender age of nine( 9).
                                I was sexually abused and got pregnant with nobody to cater for my medical and physical
                                needs.
                                I came in contact with MEMHREP during one of their street outreach programs at Asafo -
                                Kumasi.
                                They paid my ante and post natal bills, provided materially and to my outmost surprise,
                                housed me till I delivered and beyond.
                                As if that was not enough, six months after delivery, they put me on training for work.
                                Words alone cannot express the help rendered me by MEMHREP. All I can say is God richly
                                bless you MEMHREP.

                                The stigma attached to mental illness has resulted in service users losing their jobs
                                and other valuable assets after recovery.They are not recognized nor accorded the needed
                                respect.There are no measures in place to reintegrate them into society after
                                recovery.There are no laid down policies to support them financially.This occurrence has
                                delayed the recovery of many service users.

                                In January 2017, I lost both parents mysteriously. It got my younger brother into a
                                state of mental instability.
                                I spent all my savings battling his illness but to no avail leaving me financially
                                drained as well.
                                Suddenly when all hope was lost, MEMHREP came to our aid. My brother was quickly
                                enrolled into their rehabilitation program and in no time he started responding to
                                treatment.
                                Their carefully designed care plan coupled with counselling and prayer sessions turned
                                my brother's pains into gains.
                                Because of the timely intervention of MEMHREP, not only is he sane but employed as well.
                                Our appreciation goes to MEMHREP for their wonderful work to humankind.

                                The swift do not always win the race, nor do the mighty win the battle says the Bible.
                                Another adage goes” The world is wicked on the little ones.
                                My name is Linda Boateng. I was born a normal and healthy like any other kid. During my
                                school days, I was very brilliant. My ambition was to become a nurse.
                                After secondary school, I got married to a wonderful husband. Three months after
                                delivery, I heard voices speak to me. On many occasions, I would lock myself up in a
                                dark room and severally attempted suicide.
                                In my bid to seek medical treatment, I came into contact with herbalists and fake men of
                                God who swindled me of the little cash on me. My bills were too huge to afford that I
                                completely isolated myself socially.
                                Fortunately, a relative introduced me to MEMHREP. With their help, I have received
                                proper medical help from both Tafo government hospital and Komfo Anokye Teaching
                                Hospital respectively. Because of MEMHREP’s intervention, I can say” I am whole and
                                sane…….. they’ve changed my social status and also given me a second chance at life”.
                                I cannot end without asking the general public to assist this noble organisation
                                financially so they can help similar persons suffering mentally.

                                I am 34 years old mother of three beautiful girls. I speak fluent French, Ewe and
                                English. I spent most of my life at Togo, a small country that borders Ghana to the
                                East.
                                Words cannot describe how I felt when the medical doctor told me I was pregnant with my
                                first child. Fast forward, I would deliver twins on three different occasions of which
                                all the males died. It felt like walking through hell with a smile. I got lonely and
                                depressed so much that I would hear voices speak to me. To make matters worse, I got out
                                of home leaving my daughters at the care of my sick mother.
                                My first encounter with MEMHREP was miraculous for want of a better word. I had visited
                                my family at Aboagye Estates, Okyerekrom when I had a relapse. The CEO of MEMHREP who
                                was around took pity at my condition and swiftly arranged for me to be taken to Ejisu
                                government hospital for medical attention. In weeks and months that followed, the NGO
                                has care for me medically, financially and emotionally.
                                I have also been reunited with my kids and put to work. But for MEMEHREP, I would have
                                being living on the streets by now. I am forever grateful to MEMHREP.

                                I was brought up in the Christian faith and of the Catholic persuasion. God has been
                                very good to me by blessing me with three kids: two males and a female.
                                In years gone, I traded in foodstuffs that provided me the opportunity to support and
                                complement my husband financially. Life was relatively good for us. Suddenly my husband
                                was taken ill and would not survive few months after visiting various hospitals. The
                                demise of my husband was the beginning of my sickness. Days and nights after his
                                passing, I locked myself up, hurt myself with sharp objects . I would also not eat, let
                                alone take my bath. To add salt to my already bloody injury, I was kicked out of my
                                matrimonial home. Anxiety and depression set in and eventually became mentally unstable.
                                My situation became so dire that couldn’t afford the medication prescribed by the
                                doctor.
                                MEMEHREP came to offer me help when hope was all lost. Throughout the years, they have
                                taken care of all my medical needs and bills. Financially I have not been left out. With
                                their support, my monthly reviews are attended to. I am very grateful to have met them.
                                God richly MEMHREP for the care, support and assistance for persons with mental health
                                needs.

                                MEMHREP. The name is quite a mouthful but the work they do is godly.
                                Afia Nyameboah Serwaah is my name and a native of Manhyia near Konongo in the Ashanti
                                region of Ghana. When I was 15 years , I got sick and as a result dropped out of school.
                                Because of my condition, I have never had a partner to live with. Also am unable to
                                visit the market where I sell food crops for a living because of the stigmatization that
                                I encounter daily.
                                About 4 years ago, I met MEMEHREP when they embarked on an outreach program in Ejisu.
                                Through the help I received from them, my condition has improved tremendously because
                                they purchase my drugs and take me to my monthly reviews.
                                I am now back on my feet as a result of the help I got from MEMHREP. If ever there’s a
                                better word than THANK YOU, I will use that for them. God will surely reward you for
                                helping humanity.

                                I am told I got into this condition during the walking stage of my infant days. Mother
                                tells me even in those hard times, I was a delight and her favourite friend. My wish is
                                that my father had experienced those wonderful moments with me. Sad to say I never saw
                                his face. He died when I was just a year old.
                                I am an epileptic girl. As a result of my condition, I dropped out of school because of
                                the stigma. Life is indeed tough on me. The trauma only is unbearable. Sometimes I
                                wonder what wrong I have done to deserve this.
                                Fortune smiled on me when together with my mother met a nurse of MEMEHREP about 6 years
                                ago. Life has turned for the better because through MEMHREP’s intervention, I regularly
                                visit the hospital for reviews and my drugs are catered for.
                                But like Oliver Twist, I want to ask for more. My childhood dreams has always been that
                                I became a dressmaker. I know that can become a reality when the government,
                                individuals, religious bodies would come to the aid of MEMHREP financially. Therefore to
                                end my story, I would like to thank MEMHREP for the help rendered me. May the almighty
                                Allah bless their efforts at making life easy for persons living with mental illness.

                                It’s been a unique relationship built on love and trust. This relationship began when I
                                got into alcohol abuse, depression and climaxing to mental illness.
                                My sickness has brought untold hardships and disappointment to my family and friends.
                                I’ve had to sell all that I hold dear just to recover and live a simple, healthy and
                                happy life. My sickness is characterised by an aggressive behaviour. That has prevented
                                my family members from getting closer to me thereby adding to my lowliness and
                                depression.
                                About 7 years ago, I got relieved when MEMHREP came to my assistance. Through their
                                friendly approach and well­ structured counselling sessions, I have been able to receive
                                the needed medical and social help. My family life is better now and currently engaged
                                in farming thanks to MEHREP.
                                I can confidently say that” MEMHREP was my saviour and safe haven when I was in despair.
                                I am not an isolated case, therefore help MEMHREP to help others”.

                                I am a form 2 student of Okyerekrom M/A JHS in the Ejisu district of the Ashanti region
                                of Ghana. I love reading, written and watching local movies at my leisure. On weekend I
                                hardly miss my favourite food” fufu”.
                                It’s sad to narrate that I was born with a physical disability on my left arm. All
                                efforts to remedy my defect has been futile. In school and all social gatherings, I
                                always try to shy away because of the stigma that comes with my condition. Financially,
                                my family is handicapped as a result of my father’s demise.
                                I have been a beneficiary MEMHREP’s Community Support Program since 2022. I receive
                                support in the form of money, food and clothing. This benevolence on MEMHREP’s part, has
                                kept me going and I am indeed grateful. On behalf of my family, I would want to say a
                                big “AYEKOO” to MEMHREP.

                                I woke up on a hospital bed in 14th October 2022. I was told the CEO of MEMHREP saw me
                                on that faithful day dirty and unkempt and sent me to the hospital for medical
                                attention.
                                I was raised up in an orphanage after my parents divorced. During my stay, I
                                experimented with weed and eventually got addicted. Also I engaged in other social vices
                                that put my mental health state into danger. My addiction came with an aggressive
                                behaviour, fits of anger. This got me out of my family house, acquainting myself with
                                bad company.
                                With MEMHREP’s help, I have regained my sanity. They have provided me with medication,
                                food and clothing.
